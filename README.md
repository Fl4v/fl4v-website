# [Fl4v.com](https://fl4v.com)

`main` branch is used as a template for Skeleton's UI toolkit, as such dependencies and cdk are going to be bumped/updated in this public template before being merged into the `production` branch where the content for [Fl4v.com](https://fl4v.com) lives.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm ci`, start a development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
